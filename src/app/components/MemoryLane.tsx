      description: 'The second shot was way quicker maybe cause I kinda didnâ€™t want it to end so soon. We saw Rao sir, we laughed about it, and somehow ended up back at school just to hang out a little longer. I think we used the vaccine as an excuse to squeeze in one more mini date ðŸ˜‰ and Iâ€™d do it all over again',

No words, no fuss, just fingers laced and hearts racing. You didnâ€™t let go the whole way home, and honestly, I didnâ€™t want you to.',

      description: 'Our first (and only) sleepover was straight out of a movie. You showed up soaked from the rain, dripping at my doorstep like some dramatic Bollywood hero. You made butter chicken, and somehow it tasted like magic. We watched Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, then fell asleep next to each other, it was honestly the best night ever. And when you dropped me at the station at 4 AM, ugh, Iâ€™ve never hated mornings more.',

And somewhere along that ride, I said it out loud. No big speeches, just a honest little confession. And just like that, we found our way back to each other.',

Our first kiss. Quiet, electric, kind of perfect. And then we just kept kissing like the world outside didnâ€™t exist. Pretty sure the bomb wasnâ€™t the only thing exploding that night.',
